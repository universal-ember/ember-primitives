# How To Contribute

## Preparing for Dev

* `git clone <repository-url>`
* `cd ember-primitives`
* `pnpm install`
* `pnpm build`
  - builds all libraries
  - if working in a specific library, each package will have its own build script so that you only need to build what you change

## Linting

* `pnpm lint`
* `pnpm lint:fix`

## Running tests

* `cd test-app`
* `pnpm start`
* visit `/tests` at the printed URL in the terminal
